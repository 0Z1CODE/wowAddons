This addon is able to make suggestions of what spell you may want to cast next by flashing on top of the spell buttons.

To open the SpellFlash options window, you may use the following slash commands:
/spellflash
/sflash
/sf


If you have even five or ten dollars to spare it would mean an awful lot to me and my family.
